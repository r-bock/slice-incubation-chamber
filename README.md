# Slice incubation chamber
These files are [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org/) files, which create a slice incubation chamber that fits into a 50 ml glass beaker. The file is the source for both, the chamber and the grid/mesh, though there are two separate STL files for them. The small holder fits the [gas dispersion tubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/pyrex-gas-dispersion-tubes-with-fritted-cylinders-2/11138B) 
for continued oxygenation of the imersion solution.

The chamber went through multiple iterations since 2017 and the latest is *version 3 E*, 
which shows small modifications to the previous version based on specific preferences. The chambers are in constant use in a laboratory setting. 

## Materials

The print material for the chamber is [PETG](https://www.acmeplastics.com/what-is-petg), which is considered food-safe. This is a critical aspect to keep slices alive in an experimental setting.
